                    <p> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931
                        – 27
                        July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002
                        to
                        2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                        engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at
                        the
                        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation
                        (ISRO)
                        and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                        efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development
                        of
                        ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal
                        organisational,
                        technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
                        original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
